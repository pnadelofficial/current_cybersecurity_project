st.markdown('### Theoretical Foundations')
st.markdown("""
The project is rooted in the theory-practice gap literature (pioneered by
Alexander George, expanded by Philip Zelikow and others), which established a disconnect between
scholars and practitioners of foreign policy and posited that both communities would benefit from a
"smaller gap".

st.markdown('### Research Design and Case Selection')
st.markdown("""
This project evaluates the architecture of the theory-practice gap in
cybersecurity by analyzing national policy and strategy documents published between 2010 and 2023. The
research design utilizes a structured, focused comparison of the following four case studies that evaluate the
national cybersecurity guidance across three different administrations:

| Case Study 1: 2010-2011 | Case Study 2: 2014-2015 | Case Study 3: 2017-2018 | Case Study 4: 2022-2023 |
|-------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|
| 2010 National Security Strategy | 2015 National Security Strategy | 2017 National Security Strategy | 2022 National Security Strategy |
| 2011 Int'l Strategy for Cyberspace | 2015 WH Deterrence Strategy | 2018 National Cyber Strategy | 2023 National Cyber Strategy |
| 2010 Quadrennial Defense Review | 2014 Quadrennial Defense Review | 2018 National Defense Strategy | 2022 National Defense Strategy |
| 2011 National Military Strategy | 2015 National Military Strategy | 2018 National Military Strategy | 2022 National Military |
| 2011 DoD Cyber Strategy | 2015 DoD Cyber Strategy | 2018 DoD Cyber Strategy | 2022 DoD Cyber Strategy |   

&nbsp;
        
Applying Philip Zelikow’s Policy Engineering Framework, I assess the analytic components of the
hierarchy of U.S. security strategies from the National Security Strategy down to the Defense Department
Cyber Strategy for each case. The design begins with a systematic text analysis of the primary sources and
terminates with an assessment of several components of strategy implementation. The research design
relies on a dichotomous variable of alignment or misalignment to determine whether strategies developed
during this period appropriately applied the core assumptions and causal logic of the substantive theories
featured in their language.

st.markdown('### Systematic Text Analysis') 
st.markdown("""
The text analysis employs a hybrid coding technique: a deductive
a priori—or
theoretically derived—coding technique, and an inductive coding technique. Saldana (2021) refers to
a
priori coding as Provisional Coding: a start list of researcher-generated codes based on what preparatory
investigation suggests might appear in the data before they are collected and analyzed. The International
Relations theories examined throughout the Literature Review serve as categories that were disaggregated
to apply two
a priori coding techniques: Concept Coding for the theoretical Core Assumptions, and In Vivo
Coding for the key words and phrases. While analyzing the primary sources line-by-line, I inductively
captured additional expressions, constructs, and word choices that implicated theoretical concepts and
further informed the codebook. I used a Qualitative Data Analysis Software program called NVivo to store,
manage, and analyze the coded texts. Using this hybrid coding technique, I identified key words, phrases,
and core assumptions throughout the primary texts that are associated with various theoretical paradigms,
then assessed where and how those concepts overlapped with Zelikow’s Policy Engineering Framework
tasks.

st.markdown('### Methodological Goal')
st.markdown("""
The design is structured to develop a descriptive analytic framework that illuminates
what a “bridged” theory-practice gap might look like for cybersecurity. Ultimately, the larger research
agenda seeks to offer a framework that provides greater precision in measuring the existence of a gap for
any policy issue, how such gaps might be managed, and how they might matter.
