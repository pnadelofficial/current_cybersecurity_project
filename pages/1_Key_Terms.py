    * **Core Assumptions**: Foundational elements of a theory that underpin its causal logic.
    * **Causal Logic**: The linkage a theory draws between security and its likely causal variable(s).
    * **Policy Engineering**: The application of knowledge, principles, and methods to the solution of specific public problems in a given political environment (Zelikow 1994, 144)
        - Philip Zelikow differentiated seven tasks in his policy engineering framework to reveal the substance of how policies are crafted, helping policymakers and academics “see just what kinds of social science, what ‘if-then’ generalizations, are relevant” (1994, 144).
        - Zelikow’s policy engineering framework is comprised of seven distinct, iterative tasks that need not occur in chronological order: 
            1. national interests, 
            2. objectives, 
            3. strategy, 
            4. design, 
            5. implementation, 
            6. maintenance, and 
            7. policy review.
    * **First Cylce/Phase I Coding**: The analytic process of tagging the text of primary source documents according to a preliminary list of theoretical and conceptual concepts, key words, and phrases. 
    * **Second Cycle/Phase II Coding**: The analytic process of synthesizing, abstracting, and integrating coding concepts to derive deeper meaning from qualitative source data.
